    <p>Marisa is a twenty-one-year-old aspiring photographer and designer born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, currently studying at Fordham University at Lincoln Center in New York City.
      She is double majoring in Visual Arts and New Media & Digital Design, concentrating in Photography and Art, Text, and Design, respectively.
      Photography has been a passion of hers since highschool, and although she came into university with the intention of becoming a teacher, she realized art was the direction she wanted to head into.
      Last summer, she spent 7 weeks studying abroad in Rome, Italy, taking a Documentary Photography class where her and her classmates compiled a 68-page book,
