    <h2>A B O U T</h2>
    <p>“Surface Level” is an abstract photography collage portrait series that attempts to depict the complexities of a person’s identity with a medium that traditionally forces the viewer to judge only by what is seen on the surface.
      To produce each portrait, the subject is first photographed, then the photographs are printed out, cut out with a cutter and collaged by hand.

    <p>This project started with some personal frustrations I was experiencing from trying to categorize myself into one distinct nationality, as my home country, Japan, requires all dual citizens to make a “declaration of choice”, and to surrender either their Japanese or any other citizenship they might have before reaching the age of 22.
      Although it is not something that is very strictly enforced by the government, it certainly made me question and consider my identity.
      Living in a world where multi-citizenship and multi-raciality is increasingly common, it made me wonder about all of the other people who also do not quite fit into nice, clean, and easy categories.
    </p>

    <p>Our identities are so complex and multifaceted, yet we constantly make snap judgements about other people based purely on what we see on the surface.
      Beyond race and nationality, there are a vast number of factors that are unique to each and every person—religion, sexuality, experiences, emotions, thoughts, ideas, etc.—and not all of them can be perceived from the surface level.
    </p>

    <p>“Surface Level” attempts to capture more than what first meets the eye by collating, combining, and collaging multiple different photographs of the same subject from different angles, lighting, distances, while portraying different emotions and sides of themselves.
      Traditionally with photographs, the viewer is forced to make judgements based solely on what is seen in the frame. However, this series challenges that notion by utilizing more than one photograph of the subject and giving more of a deeper look at the subject’s identity by revealing a little bit more of the many complex layers that make up our identities.

    <p>I also created a Tumblr blog where I brainstormed ideas, drew inspiration, posted my progress, explored directions, and journaled my thoughts along the way, which you can take a look at <a href="https://surface-level.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
